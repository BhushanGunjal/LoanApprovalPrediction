# Loan Approval Prediction

An introductory machine learning project to predict loan approvals, demonstrating the use of various classification algorithms.




## Zip File:

The Zip file contains the dataset used for the project. Along with that, python notebook is also included having code for the model.  

## Approach used:

1. Data Acquisition: The team acquired a dataset containing relevant information for loan approval prediction.

2. Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and prepared for analysis.
   This included encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalance through resampling.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The team explored the data to understand relationships between variables and identify potential patterns.
   They used various visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to gain insights.

6. Data Modeling: Several machine learning models were trained on the prepared data, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting.

7. Model Hyperparameter Tuning: The team optimized the models by tuning their hyperparameters using GridSearchCV to improve performance.


## Conclusion:

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of 96.75% in predicting loan approvals. The project also identified potential areas for future improvement, such as feature engineering and cross-validation.
